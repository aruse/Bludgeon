# Bludgeon: The Sum of All Roguelikes

Bludgeon is an attempt to combine the best features of other roguelikes
into one game, written from scratch and utilizing modern technologies.
Version 1.0 will be a near-feature-complete clone of Nethack, and from
there Bludgeon will start incorporating other features.
