- Went throught the Python libtcod tutorial.  Re-orgainized the turtorial code to my liking.

- Decided against using libtcod due to its lack of bitmap tile support and GUI widgets.  Will use pygame instead.
- Started over fresh with new code.  Got a maze generator and basic interface set up with map, text box, and status box.
